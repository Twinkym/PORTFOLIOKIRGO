Portrfolio kirgo, I use HTML, CSS, JS to build a simple portfolio with a section tag,
where I've placed the Logo image inside an img tag which is turn nested on a 'a' label,
with a blank target to be opened in a new window, also created a restriction to not allow
the download of the logo by third parties.
